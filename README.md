# pixel-basic
pixel basic, a minimalist low detail pixel font

pixel basic is provided in 3 different glyph designs - 3px, 4px, and 5px. installing the "combined" font files will allow you to utilize each design format by changing the font weight. for applications that support numberical font weight (such as CSS), 3px is 300, 4px is 400, and 5px is 500.

# font sizing
for clean pixel rounding, use font sizes in multiples of 6px and turn font smoothing off if available

# combined vs single font families
some applications (such as OBS text sources) cannot utilize font weight to modify text display, therefore i have also provided separate font files for each glyph design in the "single" directory

# restrictions and issue resolution
no usage restrictions. this font was made for personal use so there may be issues or quirks, breaking issues i can try my best to fix but some things may be beyond my skill level
